# Set up development environment
## Option 1: Use Docker

- Build docker image: `docker build -t pyspark:latest -f Dockerfile .`
- To start the docker in interactive mode:
  Run `docker run -p 8888:8888 -it pyspark /bin/bash`
- To run notebook within docker: run `jupyter notebook`.

- More details can be found at: https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks

Info about Flint:

Follow the instructions to install

Info about MNE:

## Option 2: create virtual environments
Use `conda` or `anaconda`:
1. install `anaconda`
2. in `anaconda prompt`, navigate to `LearnFromSleep` project.
`conda env create -f environment.yaml`
3. activate environment:
`conda activate pysleep`

`PyCharm` IDE provides handy features to accelerate code development.

For the deep neural network models, it's recommended to run with GPU. 
To check is GPU is utilized:
`import tensorflow as tf
tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')`

If the output is `[]`, that means GPU is not used. If GPU exists and is utilized, output will look something like this:
`[PhysicalDevice(name='/physical_device:GPU:0', device_type='GPU')]`

# How to run
Then entry point is the `playground` folder. `RandomForest.ipynb` contains initial exploration using random forest and nearest neighbors.
`sleep_project_optimized.py` contains model finetuning and furture feature engineeering.
`deeplearnibg` folder contains explorations with CNN and LSTM models.

## Software for viewing EDF and EDF+ files
Both EDF and EDF+ formats are free and can be viewed using free software such as:

2. ISRUC_Sleep
https://sleeptight.isr.uc.pt/ISRUC_Sleep/

Polyman (for MS-Windows only; for details, please follow the link)
EDFbrowser (for Linux, Mac OS X, and MS-Windows; at www.teuniz.net)
LightWAVE and the PhysioBank ATM, platform-independent web applications from PhysioNet
WAVE and other applications for Linux, Mac OS X, and MS-Windows in the WFDB Software Package, also from PhysioNet

## Prepare Data
Transform EEG data into numpy array or pandas DataFrame:

# Model Architecture
For single sleep epoch (30s by 100Hz = 3000 data points), need to encode into a vector/tensor.
For sleep epoch sequences (for example, 8H sleep represented by multiple 30s epochs), output a sequence of categories.

CNN, SVM, or other classification models for single sleep epoch encoding.
LSTM for sequence classification.

# Train models
## track model performance using `Tensorboard`
In command line:
`tensorboard --logdir playground\logs\fit`
